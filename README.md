# Binary Seesaw Loss

A **PyTorch** implementation of a reformulated Seesaw Loss for **binary semantic segmentation**. This implementation adapts the original Seesaw Loss—proposed by [Jiaqi Wang et al. (CVPR 2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10032) for long-tailed instance segmentation—to binary tasks (e.g., vessel vs. background).
